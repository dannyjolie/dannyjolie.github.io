One day, you heard of this thing called CGI or php, and the wonderful world of server side includes. Then someone mentioned something called CSS, and then you had to learn a bit of that. Things moved pretty slowly, and life was good.</p><p> Fast forward to 2016.</p><p> I saw the optimistic minds of this generation clone humongous github repos that promise to “get you started with [something you probably don't need]”, and then turn to StackOverflow, because “It doesn't work, why?”. I have no idea what to tell these people without becoming an old fart telling them to read the fucking manual. The overwhelming amount of buzzwords and technologies that are seemingly required curriculum if you want a simple web page today is enough to drive even the seasoned developer crazy. But the remaining sane parts of my brain know this: There are no shortcuts.</p><p> Learn the basics of the technologies you are using. Start by getting your HTML and CSS in place.</p><p> Don't jump into the joys of isomorphic React applications or, god forbid, Meteor, if you don't know the difference between Java and Javascript.</p><p> Learn Javascript. Properly. Pretend jQuery doesn't exist.</p><p> Play around. Discover new things. Don't rush it with tools just because someone said you had to use Gulp or Grunt or whatever. And when you get to that point, write that Gulpfile yourself. Make <em>one</em> task, and build it from there. Install those NPM packages as you need them. After a while you'll know the common pitfalls, understand what works and what doesn't, and then, by all means, do clone that humongous github repo with fifty dependencies and thirty Gulp tasks. Do it if it makes things easier for <em>you</em>. Because, at least in principle, that's what these tools are for.</p><div id="disqus_thread" class="disqus-container"></div><script>
